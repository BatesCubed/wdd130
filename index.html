            <p>Hello! My name is Steven Bates and I am wanting to go into Front End Development as a future career. 
                I love design, and I love coding, so i think front end development is the best career for me. I grew up wanting to be an animator. Though, when I was in junior high
            I figured out that I wanted to be a graphic desiger, so then I started going to Ogden Weber Technical College for Web and Graphic design, and sense then have decided
        to go into front end development! Some of my main goals in life is to get a good job that will help me financially support my family so that my family can be comfortable.
        I love traveling and would love to be able to travel with my family as much as I can. I would love to travel to Australia the most! I have always dreamed of living in 
        Australia, so maybe that is still in my future, though for the most part I believe what will actually happen is I will be traveling to Australia.
