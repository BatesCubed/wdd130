            <p>Hello! My name is Steven Bates and I am wanting to go into Front End Development as a future career. 
                I love design, and I love coding, so i think front end development is the best career for me. I grew up wanting to be an animator. Though, when I was in junior high
            I figured out that I wanted to be a graphic desiger, so then I started going to Ogden Weber Technical College for Web and Graphic design, and sense then have decided
        to go into front end development!</p>
